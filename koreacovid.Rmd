### Data is from the Patient_Info dataset from South Korea 1 Jan to 1 May 
### This is contained in a downloadable zip file from kaggle

Some of the data was uncoded for sex - sex must be just male or female
77 of the data entries were coded sex  as blank, so we omit these.
state of a patient must be died or alive - we adjust that as well   
  
# Question 1 - Is dying independent of sex

We want to figure out if dying is independent on sex or not. To figure this out we will be using graphical, numerical,and inferential results.


Table of patients:
```{r}

# cross tabulation, patient state by gender

with(kRdata, table(Sex, result))

```

## We create two bar charts - one based on frequency and the other on percent, use ggplot commands to do this

```{r}
barchartGC(~result + Sex,data=kRdata)
barchartGC(~result + Sex,data=kRdata, type="percent")

```

 While there are still way much more woman than men.In this experiment there were more men dying from covid. 





  
## Numerical results

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~result + Sex, data=kRdata)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```

The numerical results state that men are dying off greater than two times faster then females.

## Inferential results 
```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```

This test states that men are 2.3 time more likely to die than woman. The confidence level is 95% that 1.4 is low and 3.9 is the highest so the odd ratio is 2.3.

## Conclusions
